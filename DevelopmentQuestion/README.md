# Development Question

## Level 1 (Completed)

Wrote a script named "level1.py" which reads the prompts line-by-line from the text file named "input.txt" and outputs a json file named "output.json" containing a JSON array with the required data.  
I have explained the code using comments in the python source file.

## Level 2 (Completed)

Extended the code written earlier to a client-server model. Wrote a bash script to initialize the server and create multiple clients (it also allots each client their respective part of the input file).  
I have explained the code and the functions implemented using comments.

## Level 3 (Completed)

Dockerized the system created in the previous step. Wrote Dockerfiles and used docker-compose to initialize the server and clients.
