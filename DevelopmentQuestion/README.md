# Development Question

## Level 1 (Completed)

Wrote a [script](Level1/script.py) which reads the prompts line-by-line from the [input text file](Level1/input.txt) and outputs a [json file](Level1/output.json) containing a JSON array with the required data.  
I have explained the code using comments in the python source file.

## Level 2 (Completed)

Extended the code written earlier to a [client-server model](Level2). Wrote a [bash script](Level2/run.sh) to initialize the server and create multiple clients (it also allots each client their respective part of the input file).  
I have explained the code and the functions implemented using comments.

## Level 3 (Completed)

[Dockerized the system](Level2) created in the previous step. Wrote Dockerfiles and used docker-compose to initialize the server and clients. (Changes made in Level2 directory)
